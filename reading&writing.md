Nowadays, a lot of people who have fame are being invited to take part in lots of commercial performances by/through which they get a large amount of income. Some film and television companies pay huge amount of money to these people. I tend to agree (that) some performers earn too much and I will present my reasons as follows.

At present, some young celebrities’ acting ability is not mature, and they aren’t working hard enough in the filming site. For example, actors always do not go at the panned time, and they think “I am a big star”. The second reason is the young actor can not recite the script. Some people say on the internet, actors always don't work hard and they don't have too much time to break or more private space, so the celebrities must get too much money. In the words of some of the older actors, an actor who mouths his words is a poor actor, if the performer can't even do the basics, such as punctuality, recite lines and do some job as an actor.

On the other hand, actors make more demand to economy market, they support the people more jobs and make more people to relax they main, but that might to children pay more attention to follow the actor, although make more money to celebrities, but it is not good to children to study hard.

I tend to agree lots of actors make more and more money, I strongly agree that famous people should have a lifestyle which is more similar to that of ordinary people.
