The flow charts given illustrate the process of steps in the production of cement and concrete used in construction.

First ,limestone and clay are crushed into powder by crusher and they are mixed by a mixer and then passed into a rotating heater to be heated by heat. Eventually they turned into cement and are packed in a bag.

The steps to make concrete are conplicated beginning with using 15 percent cement, 10 percent water, 25 percent sand and 50 percent gravel,small stones, to put into the concrete mixer, which is then mixed into the concrete used as a building material.

Overall, limestone and clay pass through four stages before being bagged ready for use as cement which then accounts for 15% of the four materials used to produce concrete. While the process of making cement uses a number of tools, the production of concrete requires only a concrete mixer.
