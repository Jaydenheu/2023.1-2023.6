The diagrams given illustrate the process of steps in the production of cement and concrete used in construction.

First ,limestone and clay are crushed into powder by the crusher and the powder then is mixed by a mixer and then passed into a rotating heater to be heated by heat. Eventually it turned into cement and is put into a bag.

The steps to make concrete are easy. Firstï¼Œ15 percent cement, 10 percent water, 25 percent sand and 50 percent gravel, which is small stones, are put into the concrete mixer, which is then mixed into the concrete used as building materials.

Overall, limestone and clay pass through five stages before being bagged ready for use as cement which then accounts for 15% of the four materials used to produce concrete. While the process of making cement uses a number of tools, the production of concrete requires only a concrete mixer.
