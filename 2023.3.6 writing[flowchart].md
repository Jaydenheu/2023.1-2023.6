The flow chart given illustrates the process of steps in the production of cement and concrete used in construction.

First ,limestone and clay are crushed into powder by crusher and it is mixed with a mixer and then passed into a rotating heater to be heated by heat. Eventually he turned into cement and put it in a bag.

The steps to make concrete are the first 15percent cement 10 percent water 25 percent sand and 50 percent gravel,is small stones, were put into the concrete mixer, which is then mixed into the concrete used as a building material.

Overall, limestone and clay pass through four stages before being bagged ready for use as cement which then accounts for 15% of the four materials used to produce concrete. While the process of making cement uses a number of tools, the production of concrete requires only a concrete mixer.
